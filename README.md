##  ROCK PAPER SCISSORS CHAMPIONSHIP EDITION

Unused game jam idea that I think would be fun to work on

2D, Single Player or Multiplayer, Strategy Game
Inspired by Rock, Paper, Scissors
and Buckshot Roulette
and Inscryption

PLAYER has a deck of 15 cards, each with equal copies of ROCK, PAPER, and SCISSORS.
OPPONENT also has a similar deck of 15 cards.

Each player draws until they have 3 cards, and plays their card facedown.  When both players play their cards, the facedown card is revealed, and the game plays like Rock, Paper, Scissors.  After the showdown, both cards are discarded.

First player to 5 points wins.  

Both players will have access to consumable skills:
Examples:
CLAIRVOYANCE:  See two of your opponent’s cards in their hand.
FUTURE SIGHT:  See the top of your opponent’s deck, and choose whether to keep it on the top, or place it on the bottom of their deck.
FORCED DEAL:  Pick a card from your hand, and swap it with a card from your opponent’s hand.
OVERWHELMING ODDS:  You get to play another card this turn, but do not draw next turn.
STACKED DECK:  Change the top card of your deck to ROCK, PAPER, or SCISSORS.
OVERCOME:  In the case of a tie, you win.  If your opponent has played OVERCOME, both effects are negated.
DOUBLE OR NOTHING:  The next hand is worth one more point.
IMPRISON:  Pick a card from your opponent’s hand.  You get to see it, and it cannot be played this turn.
